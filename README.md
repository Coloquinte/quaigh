# Quaigh

<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

Logic simplification and analysis tools

This crate provides tools for logic optimization, synthesis, technology mapping and analysis.
Our goal is to provide an easy-to-use library, and improve its quality over time to match industrial tools.

## Usage and features

Quaigh provides a command line tool, that can be installed using
[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):
`cargo install quaigh`.

To show available commands:
```bash
quaigh help
```

The `atpg` command performs [automatic test pattern generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_test_pattern_generation),
to create test vectors for a design.
```bash
quaigh atpg mydesign.bench -o atpg.test
```

The `check-equivalence` command performs bounded [equivalence checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_equivalence_checking)
to confirm that a design's functionality is preserved after transformations.
```bash
quaigh equiv mydesign.bench optimized.bench
```

The `optimize` command performs [logic optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_optimization).
At the moment, logic optimization is far from state of the art: for production designs, you should
generally stick to the tools included in [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys).
```bash
quaigh opt mydesign.bench -o optimized.bench
```

Quaigh supports a subset of the [Blif](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ee760/760docs/blif.pdf) file format, as well
as the simple Bench file format used by ISCAS benchmarks. Benchmarks can be downloaded
[here](https://github.com/Coloquinte/moosic-yosys-plugin/releases/download/iscas_benchmarks/benchmarks.tar.xz).
More features will be added over time, such as technology mapping, operator optimization, ...
The complete documentation is available on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/crate/quaigh/latest).

## Development

### Philosophy

In most logic optimization libraries ([ABC](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc), [Mockturtle](https://github.com/lsils/mockturtle), ...),
there are many different datastructures depending on the kind of logic representation that is optimized:
AIG, MIG, LUT, ...
Depending on the circuit, one view or the other might be preferable.
Taking advantage of them all may require [splitting the circuit](https://github.com/lnis-uofu/LSOracle), making most operations much more complex.
More generic netlists, like [Yosys RTLIL](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/CHAPTER_Overview.html#the-rtl-intermediate-language-rtlil),
will allow all kind of logic gates in a single datastructure.
Since they do not restrict the functions represented, they are difficult to work directly for logic optimization.

Quaigh aims in-between. All algorithms operate on a single datastructure, `Network`.
This makes it possible to compare representations using completely different gates.
An algorithm targeting And gates (for example) can ignore everything else.
Compared to a netlist datastructure, it is flat and focuses completely on logic optimization.

### Datastructures

`Network` is a typical Gate-Inverter-Graph representation of a logic circuit.
Inverters are implicit, occupying just one bit in `Signal`.
It supports many kinds of logic, and all can coexist in the same circuit:
*   Complex gates such as Xor, Mux and Maj3 are all first class citizens;
*   Flip-flops with enable and reset are represented directly.

Since the structure targets logic optimization, it maintains some limitations to make algorithms simpler.
All gates have a single output, representing a single binary value.
The network is kept in topological order, so that a given gate has an index higher than its inputs.
Finally, it does not attempt to handle names or design hierarchy.

For example, here is a full adder circuit:
```rust
let mut net = Network::new();
let i0 = net.add_input();
let i1 = net.add_input();
let i2 = net.add_input();
let carry = net.add(Gate::maj(i0, i1, i2));
let out = net.add(Gate::xor3(i0, i1, i2));
net.add_output(carry);
net.add_output(out);
```
